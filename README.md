### Setup Project
 This is our starter react file we would use for the projects

 To access this project run the command `npm install` to install the node packages

 Use `npm run dev` to start the project after installing the node packages 

### Routes done
I have set up the routes for the project in the App.jsx file. This is the latest routing system used by developers.
